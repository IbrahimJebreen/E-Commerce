# E-Commerce
The possibility of buying from anywhere, at any time and from multiple devices has favoured the rise of online shopping in our country. But online sales are not homogeneous in both men and women, which is why we have ventured to review how men and women buy online.

When carrying out your eCommerce strategy, you need to know who your productâ€™s target is. Buying decisions change according to the gender of consumers. For example, what women may find amazing, men could find it a normal object. That is the reason why we should establish a different strategy for our campaigns, depending on the target.

It is therefore important to understand the characteristics that differentiate men and women and their needs and purchasing decisions, since in many cases varies according to gender.
